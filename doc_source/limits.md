## Amazon EFS Limits That You Can Increase<a name="soft-limits"></a>

Following are the limits for Amazon EFS that you can increase by contacting AWS Support\. These are throughput limits, and they are defined by the throughput mode that you choose for your file system, Bursting or Provisioned\. For more information on these different modes, see [Amazon EFS Performance](performance.md)\.

Bursting Throughput mode limits are as follows\.


| Resource | Default Limit | 
| --- | --- | 
| Total throughput for all connected clients |  US East \(Ohio\) Region – 3 GB/s US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region – 3 GB/s US West \(N\. California\) Region – 1 GB/s US West \(Oregon\) Region – 3 GB/s Asia Pacific \(Seoul\) – 1 GB/s Asia Pacific \(Singapore\) – 1 GB/s Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\) – 1 GB/s EU \(Frankfurt\) Region – 1 GB/s EU \(Ireland\) Region – 3 GB/s Asia Pacific \(Sydney\) Region – 3 GB/s  | 

Provisioned Throughput mode limits are as follows\.


| Resource | Default Limit | 
| --- | --- | 
| Total throughput for all clients |  All regions – 1 GB/s  | 

You can take the following steps to request an increase for these limits\. These increases are not granted immediately, so it might take a couple of days for your increase to become effective\.

**To request a limit increase**

1. Open the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/) page, sign in, if necessary, and then choose **Create Case**\.

1. Under **Regarding**, choose **Service Limit Increase**\.

1. Under **Limit Type**, choose the type of limit to increase, fill in the necessary fields in the form, and then choose your preferred method of contact\.

## Resource Limits<a name="limits-efs-resources-per-account-per-region"></a>

Following are the limits on Amazon EFS resources for each customer account in an AWS Region\. 


| Resource | Limit | 
| --- | --- | 
| Number of file systems |  US East \(Ohio\) Region – 125 US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region – 70 US West \(N\. California\) Region – 125 US West \(Oregon\) Region – 125 Asia Pacific \(Seoul\) 125 Asia Pacific \(Singapore\) 125 Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\) 125 EU \(Frankfurt\) Region – 125 EU \(Ireland\) Region – 125 Asia Pacific \(Sydney\) Region – 125  | 
| Number of mount targets for each file system in an Availability Zone | 1 | 
| Number of security groups for each mount target | 5 | 
| Number of tags for each file system | 50 | 
| Number of VPCs for each file system | 1 | 

## Limits for Client EC2 Instances<a name="limits-client-specific"></a>

The following limits for client EC2 instances apply, assuming a Linux NFSv4\.1 client:

| Resource | Limit | 
| --- | --- | 
| Throughput per Amazon EC2 instance | 250 MB/s | 
| Active user accounts per instance with files open at the same time (each user account represents one local user logged in to the instance) | 128 |
| Files open at the same time on the instance | 32,768 |

+ Each unique mount on the instance can acquire up to a total of 8,192 locks across a maximum of 256 unique file/process pairs\. For example, a single process can acquire one or more locks on 256 separate files, or 8 processes can each acquire one or more locks on 32 files\.
+ Using Amazon EFS with Microsoft Windows Amazon EC2 instances is not supported\.

## Limits for Amazon EFS File Systems<a name="limits-fs-specific"></a>

| Resource | Limit | 
| --- | --- | 
| Name length | 255 bytes | 
| Symbolic link \(symlink\) length | 4080 bytes |
| Number of hard links to a file | 177 |
| Single file size | 52,673,613,135,872 bytes \(47\.9 TiB\) |
| Directory depth | 1000 levels |


+ symbolic link \(symlink\) length: 4080 bytes\.
+ number of hard links to a file: 177\.
+ size of a single file: 52,673,613,135,872 bytes \(47\.9 TiB\)\.
+ directory depth: 1000 levels deep\.
+ Any one particular file can have up to 87 locks across all users of the file system\. You can mount a file system on one or more Amazon EC2 instances, but the maximum 87\-lock limit for a file applies\.
+ In General Purpose mode, there is a limit of 7000 file system operations per second\. This operations limit is calculated for all clients connected to a single file system\.

## Limits for EFS File Sync<a name="limits-file-sync"></a>

Following are the limits on EFS File Sync resources for each customer account in an AWS Region\. 


| Resource | Limit | 
| --- | --- | 
| Maximum number of sync tasks | 10 | 
| Maximum number of files for each sync task | 35,000,000  | 
| Maximum file ingest rate for each sync task | 500 files per second | 
| Maximum data throughput for each sync task | 1 Gbps | 

## Unsupported NFSv4 Features<a name="nfs4-unsupported-features"></a>

Although Amazon Elastic File System does not support NFSv2, or NFSv3, Amazon EFS supports both NFSv4\.1 and NFSv4\.0, except for the following features:
+ pNFS
+ Client delegation or callbacks of any type
  + Operation OPEN always returns `OPEN_DELEGATE_NONE` as the delegation type\. 
  + The operation OPEN returns `NFSERR_NOTSUPP` for the `CLAIM_DELEGATE_CUR` and `CLAIM_DELEGATE_PREV` claim types\.
+ Mandatory locking

  All locks in Amazon EFS are advisory, which means that READ and WRITE operations do not check for conflicting locks before the operation is executed\. 
+ Deny share

  NFS supports the concept of a share deny, primarily used by Windows clients for users to deny others access to a particular file that has been opened\. Amazon EFS does not support this, and returns the NFS error `NFS4ERR_NOTSUPP` for any OPEN commands specifying a share deny value other than `OPEN4_SHARE_DENY_NONE`\. Linux NFS clients do not use anything other than `OPEN4_SHARE_DENY_NONE`\.
+ Access control lists \(ACL\)
+ Amazon EFS does not update the `time_access` attribute on file reads\. Amazon EFS updates `time_access` in the following events:
  + When a file is created \(an inode is created\)\.
  + When an NFS client makes an explicit `setattr` call\. 
  + On a write to the inode caused by, for example, file size changes or file metadata changes\.
  + Any inode attribute is updated\.
+ Namespaces
+ Persistent reply cache
+ Kerberos based security
+ NFSv4\.1 data retention
+ SetUID on directories
+ Unsupported file types when using the CREATE operation: Block devices \(NF4BLK\), character devices \(NF4CHR\), attribute directory \(NF4ATTRDIR\), and named attribute \(NF4NAMEDATTR\)\.
+ Unsupported attributes: FATTR4\_ARCHIVE, FATTR4\_FILES\_AVAIL, FATTR4\_FILES\_FREE, FATTR4\_FILES\_TOTAL, FATTR4\_FS\_LOCATIONS, FATTR4\_MIMETYPE, FATTR4\_QUOTA\_AVAIL\_HARD, FATTR4\_QUOTA\_AVAIL\_SOFT, FATTR4\_QUOTA\_USED, FATTR4\_TIME\_BACKUP, and FATTR4\_ACL\.

   An attempt to set these attributes results in an `NFS4ERR_ATTRNOTSUPP` error that is sent back to the client\. 

## Additional Considerations<a name="limits-additional-considerations"></a>

In addition, note the following:
+ For a list of AWS Regions where you can create Amazon EFS file systems, see the [AWS General Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticfilesystem_region)\.
+ Some AWS accounts created before 2012 might have access to Availability Zones in us\-east\-1 that don't support creating mount targets\. If you can't create a mount target in one of these AWS Regions, try a different Availability Zone in that AWS Region\. However, there are cost considerations for mounting a file system on an EC2 instance in an Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability Zone\. 
+ You mount your file system from EC2 instances in your VPC by using the mount targets you create in the VPC\. You can also mount your file system on your EC2\-Classic instances \(which are not in the VPC\), but you must first link them to your VPC by using ClassicLink\. For more information about using ClassicLink, see [ClassicLink](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/vpc-classiclink.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.
+ You can mount an Amazon EFS file system from on\-premises data center servers using AWS Direct Connect\.
+ VPC peering within a single AWS Region when using C5 or M5 instances is supported\. However, other VPC private connectivity mechanisms such as a VPN connection, inter\-region VPC peering, and intraregion VPC peering using other instance types are not supported\.
