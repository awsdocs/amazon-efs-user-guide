# File and Directory Permissions<a name="user-and-group-permissions"></a>

Files and directories in an EFS file system support standard Unix\-style read, write, and execute permissions based on the user and group ID asserted by the mounting NFSv4\.1 client, unless overridden by an EFS access point\.  For more information, see [Working with Users, Groups, and Permissions at the Network File System \(NFS\) Level](accessing-fs-nfs-permissions.md)\.

**Note**  
By default, this layer of access control depends on trusting the NFSv4\.1 client in its assertion of the user and group ID\. You can use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) resource\-based policies and identity policies to authorize NFS clients and provide read\-only, write, and root access permissions\. You can use EFS access points to override the operating system user and group identity information provided by the NFS client\. For more information, see [Using IAM to Control NFS Access to Amazon EFS](iam-access-control-nfs-efs.md) and [Creating and deleting access points](create-access-point.md)\.

As an example of read, write, and execute permissions for files and directories, Alice might have permissions to read and write to any files that she wants to in her personal directory on a file system, `/alice`\. However, in this example Alice is not allowed to read or write to any files in Mark's personal directory on the same file system, `/mark`\. Both Alice and Mark are allowed to read but not write files in the shared directory `/share`\.
